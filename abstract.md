# Rasterio: Geospatial Raster Data Access for Python Programmers

## Brief Description

(One paragraph, 400 chars max)

Learn how to read, manipulate, and write geospatial raster data such as
satellite imagery using a more productive, more fun — more Zen – GDAL and
Numpy-based library named Rasterio. It’s a new open source project from the
satellite team at Mapbox informed by a decade of experience using Python and
GDAL.

## Detailed Abstract

(Public if proposal is accepted)

Rasterio is a GDAL and Numpy-based Python library written to make work with
geospatial raster data more productive, more fun — more Zen. Its design
embodies lessons learned over a decade of using GDAL and Python to solve
geospatial problems.

I will discuss the motivation for writing Rasterio and explain how and why it
diverges from other GIS software and embraces Python types, protocols, and
idioms.  I will also explain why Rasterio adheres to some GIS paradigms and
bends or breaks others.

Finally, I will show examples of using Rasterio to read, manipulate, and write
georeferenced raster data. Some examples will be familiar to users of older
Python GIS software and will illustrate how Rasterio lets more work be done
with less code and fewer bugs.  I will also demonstrate fun features of
Rasterio not found in other geospatial libraries.
