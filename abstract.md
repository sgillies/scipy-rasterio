# Rasterio: Geospatial Raster Data Access for Python Programmers

## Brief Description

(One paragraph, 400 chars max)

Learn to read, manipulate, and write georeferenced imagery and other kinds of
geospatial raster data using a productive and fun GDAL and Numpy-based library
named Rasterio. It’s a new open source project from the satellite team at
Mapbox and is informed by a decade of experience using Python and GDAL.

## Detailed Abstract

(Public if proposal is accepted)

Rasterio is a GDAL and Numpy-based Python library written to make work with
geospatial raster data more productive, more fun — more Zen of Python. Its
design embodies lessons learned over a decade of using GDAL and Python to solve
geospatial problems.

I will discuss the motivation for writing Rasterio and explain how and why it
diverges from other GIS software and embraces Python types, protocols, and
idioms.  I will also explain why Rasterio adheres to some GIS paradigms and
bends or breaks others.

Finally, I will show examples of using Rasterio to read, manipulate, and write
georeferenced raster data. Some examples will be familiar to users of older
Python GIS software and will illustrate how Rasterio lets you get more done
with less code and fewer bugs. I will also demonstrate fun and useful features
of Rasterio not found in other geospatial libraries.

## Additional Notes

(The pitch. Not part of conference materials)

The Rasterio home page: https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio.

Rasterio has more mature and widely used siblings: Shapely and Fiona. I plan to 
mention these and briefly show how they integrate with Rasterio.

Along with slides, I will make the examples in my talk available as an IPython
notebook.
