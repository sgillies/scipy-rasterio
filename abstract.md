# Rasterio: Geospatial Raster Data Access for Python Programmers

## Brief Description

(One paragraph, 400 chars max)

Rasterio is a GDAL and Numpy-based Python library designed to make your work
with geospatial raster data more productive, more fun — more Zen. It’s a new
open source project from the satellite team at Mapbox.

## Detailed Abstract

(Public if proposal is accepted)

Rasterio is Python software, not GIS software. Whether you are an experienced
Python programmer beginning to explore raster data processing and analysis, or
a geographic data hacker branching out into Python programming, you can get
more done with less code and fewer bugs thanks to rasterio’s use of Python
language types, and protocols, and idioms.
